# Roadmap
This roadmap outlines my upcoming projects and improvements.

## Projects
The upcoming projects are listed here:
- **Nobody is perfect**: A game assistant for nobody is perfect using Websockets.
This will include session management on the backend server, maybe database persistence.
- **Connect 4**: An AI for the game connect 4. Implemented similarly like catan, with
backend server logic and session management.
- **Hashiwokakero**: Implementing the game hashi to be able to play limitless online. The
logic has to be migrated to the backend server.
- **Qwirkle**: Implementing an AI to find the best move for a given position in the 
game qwirkle. This will be done with opencv for image recognition.
- **Wordle Solver**: A solver finding the best move for the online game wordle. This can be done with information gain decision
trees, to find the best guess for each situation.
- **Weaver Solver**: A program to solve the game weaver, the solving logic should happen on the backend.
- **Risk Probabilities**: A simulation for risk battle probabilities. This has to be migrated to the full-stack website.
